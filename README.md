face_recognition installation :
1.Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 or newer (check if build tools are enough): https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/ - download and install
2.Download and install CMake for Windows: https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.16.2/cmake-3.16.2-win64-x64.msi (other options available at: https://cmake.org/download/) During installation check to add CMake to PATH for all users (leave everything else default).

3.Restart Windows (simply starting new cmd window so it will include changes in PATH should be enough, restart is a safer option though)
pip install --upgrade numpy scipy
